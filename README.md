# pandoc-sidenote

> Convert Pandoc Markdown-style footnotes into sidenotes

This is a simple [Pandoc filter] to convert footnotes into a format that can be
consumed by [Tufte CSS]. On the whole, this project weighs in at well under 100
lines of code. Check out [SideNote.hs](src/Text/Pandoc/SideNote.hs) if you're curious how it works.

It's used by calling `pandoc --filter pandoc-sidenote`. To see it in action, see
[Tufte Pandoc CSS], a project which uses it. In particular, take a look at the
Makefile included in that project.

The core functionality is also exposed as a library, which can be called by Haskell
applications such as Hakyll.

## Dependencies

`pandoc-sidenote` is build against a specific version of Pandoc. This table maps
`pandoc` versions to `pandoc-sidenote` versions:

| pandoc | pandoc-sidenote |
| ------ | --------------- |
| 2.x, 1.19   | 0.19.0          |
| 1.18   | 0.9.0           |

If a newer version of `pandoc` has been released, the Stack build manifest
will need to be adjusted for that version, and the project then rebuilt.

## Installation

### Cabal

`pandoc-sidenote` is on Hackage and can thus be installed using `cabal`:
